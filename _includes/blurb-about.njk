  I’m Jeremy Knight, an engineering leader and software developer based in Greater New Orleans. 
  I’ve spent my career working with .NET, ASP.NET, C#, and modern web technologies, and I enjoy 
  building solutions that are reliable, practical, and easy for people to use.
</p>
<p>
  I’m passionate about mentoring. Working alongside exceptional developers has been a privilege, 
  and I enjoy paying forward the knowledge and guidance they’ve shared with me. Since 2011, I’ve 
  been active in the developer community as a speaker and organizer for local .NET user groups in 
  New Orleans, Houma‑Thibodaux, and <a href="https://www.brdnug.org/" target="_blank">Baton Rouge</a>. 
  I’ve presented at events like <a href="https://www.sqlsatbr.com/" target="_blank">SQL Saturday</a>, 
  covering topics such as unit testing, ADO.NET, and advanced software testing.
</p>
<p>
  Along the way, I’ve worked extensively with Microsoft technologies, SQL Server, and frameworks 
  like Blazor, Angular, and Bootstrap. I create open‑source projects both to learn and to share 
  what I discover, ranging from developer utilities to creative apps like the Photo Collage Screensaver.
</p>
<p>
  My approach is rooted in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship" target="_blank">craftsmanship</a>: 
  clear communication, dependable solutions, and helping teams succeed together.
