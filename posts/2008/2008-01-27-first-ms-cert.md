It's official. I took my first Microsoft certification (Exam 70-528 .Net 2.0 Web-Based Client Development) and passed with flying colors. I was a bit nervous going into the exam as the test prep book had some really hard questions. Fortunately, the test ended up being really easy after all the prep I put myself through because of those questions.

I plan on finishing up this semester (final toward Masters degree) and then I'm going to try to get at least one certification test done every 3-4 months. I may even get another one done during the semester since I'm being sent to two SharePoint development classes.
