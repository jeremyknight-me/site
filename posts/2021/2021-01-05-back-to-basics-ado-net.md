I will be presenting "Back to Basics: ADO.NET" on Jan 13th to the [Baton Rouge .NET User Group](https://www.brdnug.org/). This will be a beginner topic and I'll be assuming no ADO.NET experience. All code examples will be in C#. Here's the description I sent in:

> Microsoft says Entity Framework (EF) is "an object-relational mapper (or ORM) that eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write". This session will show the basics of data access that ORMs like EF tend to obscure. It will also show how to use ADO.NET to integrate with and augment EF when it falls short.
