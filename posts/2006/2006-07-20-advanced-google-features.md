Unbeknown to most, the seemingly simple Google Search box is really very powerful. The following examples are just some of the ways that Google Search can be used.

**Google Calculator**

Google allows you to do calculations right in the search box. You can do basic arithmetic (+, -, /, \*) but it also allows for a few other calculations.

> **Examples:** Percentage of: 45% of 39 Raise to a power: 2^5 or 2\*\*5 Convert Units: 300 Euros in USD

**Google Safe Search**

Every now and then you want to search for a topic that you know may return some adult results. For those of us that don't want to be bothered with adult content, Google has provided a way to prevent adult content from displaying in results. The following example shows what you would type if you wanted to search Google for "sex education" and not have adult sites in your search results.

> **Example** safesearch: sex education
> 
> **Generic** safesearch:

**Special Searches with Google**

You can easily find the definition of words, movie information and showtimes, phone numbers, and even your local weather using Google.

> **Generic** define: phonebook: bphonebook: rphonebook: movie: weather
> 
> **Examples** define:words phonebook: New Orleans, LA bphonebook: New Orleans, LA rphonebook: New Orleans, LA movie: Superman Returns weather New Orleans, LA

For the phonebook information, "bphonebook" searches business numbers only while "rphonebook" searches residential numbers only.

**Site Specific Searches with Google**

Google provides users with ways to search only within one website and to find all pages linked to a specific webpage.

To search within a website:

> **Generic** site:
> 
> **Example** contact information site:www.jeremyknight.me

To find all linked pages:

> **Generic** link:
> 
> **Example** link:www.jeremyknight.me
