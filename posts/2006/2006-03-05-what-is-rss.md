RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, is a format for sharing website content. RSS allows you to subscribe to websites that offer RSS feeds. Today you can find RSS feeds on news sites such as CNN and Wired, blog sites, and many more. The list of uses for RSS, as well as the list of sites using it, is growing daily.

Software is needed to read RSS feeds, and, to the delight of many users, it can be found for your computer as well being offered as a service by some websites. Sites like [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/) and [Protopage](http://www.protopage.com/) allow users to keep there RSS feeds online so that they may read them from any computer, while programs like [Mozilla's Firefox](http://www.mozilla.com/), [Feedreader](http://www.feedreader.com/), and [SharpReader](http://www.sharpreader.net/) allow users to view feeds from the comfort of their own home. For those that wish to read their feeds from home but don't want additional programs, email programs are starting to integrate RSS reading functionality. [Mozilla's Thunderbird](http://www.mozilla.com/) email program already has this capability while [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) has said the next version of Outlook will have it included.
