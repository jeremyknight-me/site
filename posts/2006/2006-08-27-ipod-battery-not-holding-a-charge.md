Next time you think your battery is going bad in your iPod because it doesn't hold a charge anymore just try draining the battery completely.

If you've read through the blog, you know that I own a 30GB iPod video ([Post](http://www.jeremyknight.me/post/new-ipod "Link to New iPod Post")). I bought it so that I could have something to listen to while I'm at work and I found that it can easily go the entire work day on a single charge. But, one day recently, I went to work, turned on my iPod, and about 3-4 hours later my iPod showed low battery. I couldn't figure out what was going on and immediately I thought that my battery was going bad. Then I calmed down and started thinking about it. Never in the time that I had owned my iPod, had I ever let the battery discharge. It was worth a shot since I thought I'd be buying a new battery or even iPod. I just let my iPod play until the battery was completely dead and when I got home from work that night I plugged it in to charge overnight. The next morning when I got to work I turned it on and let it play. I left work that day and it was still going strong, EQ and all.
