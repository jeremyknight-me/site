I took the "MCTS: Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, ADO.NET Application Development" test yesterday. I passed but there were a few curve balls. For the most part though, it seemed like if you study at all the process of elimination can get you through this test. Most questions had at least 2 answers that could easily be eliminated.
