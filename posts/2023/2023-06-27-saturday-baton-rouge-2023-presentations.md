I will be presenting at [SQL Saturday Baton Rouge 2023](https://sqlsaturday.com/2023-07-29-sqlsaturday1060/ "SQL Saturday Baton Rouge 2023") on July 29, 2023.

<h3>Back to Basics: ADO.NET</h3>

This will be a beginner topic and I'll be assuming only basic understanding of Entity Framework. All code examples will be in C#. Here's the session's description:
 
> Microsoft says Entity Framework (EF) is "an object-relational mapper (or ORM) that eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write". This session will show the basics of data access that ORMs like EF tend to obscure. It will also show how to use ADO.NET to integrate with and complement EF when it falls short.
