I will be presenting twice at [SQL Saturday Baton Rouge 2023](https://sqlsaturday.com/2023-07-29-sqlsaturday1060/ "SQL Saturday Baton Rouge 2023") on July 29, 2023.

<h3>Back to Basics: ADO.NET</h3>

This will be a beginner topic and I'll be assuming only basic understanding of Entity Framework. All code examples will be in C#. Here's the session's description:
 
> Microsoft says Entity Framework (EF) is "an object-relational mapper (or ORM) that eliminates the need for most of the data-access code that developers usually need to write". This session will show the basics of data access that ORMs like EF tend to obscure. It will also show how to use ADO.NET to integrate with and complement EF when it falls short.

<h3>Testing In-Depth</h3>

This will be an intermediate topic and I'll be assuming some experience with unit testing. All code examples will be in C#. Here's the session's description:

> Software testing is a vital skill for any developer who wants to deliver high-quality, reliable software. This session will explore unit testing and more advanced topics, such as mocking, integration tests, and mutation testing. It will also show tools and packages that can help you automate your testing process and make it more productive.
