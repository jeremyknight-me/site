If you're using Office 64-bit and you're having issues with SharePoint's datasheet view, this post is for you.

Our team recently upgraded the software on our equipment and Office 2010 64-bit was our chosen Office version. Soon after, people started asking why the datasheet view was no longer working. Â It just so happens that SharePoint's datasheet view doesn't play nice with 64-bit client software.

Why? The datasheet view uses a 32-bit ActiveX control. Internet Explorer 64-bit disables the datasheet view and without a 32-bit Office install IE 32-bit will give the following error:

Don't fret though. There will be no need to downgrade to a 32-bit version of Office. This problem can be fixed by installing the [2007 Office System Driver: Data Connectivity Components](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=7554F536-8C28-4598-9B72-EF94E038C891&displaylang=en "2007 Office System Driver: Data Connectivity Components"). Once the downloaded AccessDatabaseEngine.exe is installed, the datasheet functionality should work in both SharePoint 2007 and SharePoint 2010.
