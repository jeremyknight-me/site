This Saturday (August 14th) LSU will be hosting SQL Saturday #28. The all day event will feature a number of great sessions and speakers. If you're a technology professional in the Baton Rouge area, this event is a must. Along with the speakers and sessions, there will be plenty of local technology professionals attending (close to 600 registered attendees) which should make it a great event for networking.

The local user groups will also have a table setup to help spread the word. If you're interested in getting involved with the .NET, SQL, or SharePoint user groups, please stop in and say hello. I'll probably spend most of the day at the table talking up the New Orleans SharePoint User Group.
