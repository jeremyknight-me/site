I will be presenting at the November 11th meeting of the [Greater New Orleans SharePoint User Group](http://www.gnospug.com "Greater New Orleans SharePoint User Group"). The topic will be **SharePoint Web Parts and Best Practices**. The presentation will focus on the 2010 product family and all code will be released after the presentation.
