A coworker pointed me at the following blog post:

This post is based off of a [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com "StackOverflow") post found here:

[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2349378/new-programming-jargon-you-coined](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2349378/new-programming-jargon-you-coined)

I'm sure all of my programmer brethren will find these links good for a few laughs.
