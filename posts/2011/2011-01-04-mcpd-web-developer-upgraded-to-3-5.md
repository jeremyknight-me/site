Over the holidays, I upgraded my MCPD to .NET 3.5. Now only one more to go to catch up to latest release. This was my first upgrade so I didn't know what was going on until after I was done. They split the upgrade up into 2 banks of questions representing the 2 tests for that MCPD. Just a heads up for those wondering why you get told you'll get 40-something questions and end up with 1 of 20-something on the first screen.
