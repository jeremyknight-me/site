I presented "Developing Custom Web Parts" at the recent SharePoint Saturday New Orleans 2011. Here's the description was:

> Web parts are a logical starting point for ASP.NET developers to begin their journey into SharePoint. This session focuses on the ins and outs of web part development as well as web part and SharePoint development best practices. Code examples will use C#.
