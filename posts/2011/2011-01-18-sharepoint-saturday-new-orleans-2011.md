First, [SharePoint Saturday New Orleans 2011](http://www.sharepointsaturday.org/neworleans/default.aspx "SharePoint Saturday New Orleans 2011") has [opened registration](http://spsnola2011-ws.eventbrite.com/ "SharePoint Saturday New Orleans 2011 Registration") and placed the session list online. If you're interested in SharePoint at all this is a must attend event. The sessions span all areas of SharePoint including project management, end users/power users tools, administration, architecture, development and more.

Secondly, I will be presenting "Developing Custom Web Parts". No SharePoint experience required but I am recommending ASP.NET experience if you attend. Here's the description I sent in:

> Web parts are a logical starting point for ASP.NET developers to begin their journey into SharePoint. This session focuses on the ins and outs of web part development as well as web part and SharePoint development best practices. Code examples will use C#.
