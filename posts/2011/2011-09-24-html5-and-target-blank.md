I posted a [jQuery solution to the XHTML Strict Target="\_blank" problem](http://jeremyknight.wordpress.com/2010/11/27/jquery-xhtml-strict-target-blank-solution/ "jQuery XHTML Strict Target=”_blank” Solution") a while back. Well I finally had some free time to start delving deep into HTML5. Low and behold the W3C has removed the deprecated status from the "\_blank" value for the target attribute. What does that mean?

That means that target="\_blank" is 100% valid in HTML5!
