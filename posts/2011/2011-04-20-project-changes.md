If you've looked at my Projects page recently, you may have noticed that there were a few changes.

**docXtract**

The bad news first. I have removed docXtract. I found that [Sandcastle](http://sandcastle.codeplex.com/ "Sandcastle") and it's supporting tools (most notably [Sandcastle Help File Builder](http://shfb.codeplex.com/ "Sandcastle Help File Builder")) have grown to a point that there is no need for another product.

**Visual Studio Code Snippets**

Now the good news. I've been working on a Logitech G11 keyboard which has 18 macro keys. I've been assigning code snippet macros to the keys and it has been increasing my productivity tremendously. I've also started writing my own code snippets. This new project is an online home for those snippets.
