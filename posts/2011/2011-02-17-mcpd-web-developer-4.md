Right on the heels of the upgrade to Web Developer 3.5, I took the test for an upgrade to .NET 4. I've finally caught up to the latest release.Â I have to say this was the longest Microsoft certification test that I've taken. It was over 80 questions long and split into 4 sections. For a second I thought my test would be lost. When I clicked to finish the exam the testing software crashed. Fortunately, everything was there just like I left it when they rebooted the computer.
