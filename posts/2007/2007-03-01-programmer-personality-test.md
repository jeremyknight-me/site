I found this and thought that it was pretty interesting. I've just went through all the personality tests I can think of in my Organizational Behavior class but this one was right up my ally.

[The Programmer Personality Test](http://www.doolwind.com/index.php?page=11 "The Programmer personality Test")

Here's what mine ended up looking like:

> Your programmer personality type is: **PHTB**
> 
> **You're a Planner.** You may be slow, but you'll usually find the best solution. If something's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
> 
> **You like coding at a High level.** The world is made up of objects and components, you should create your programs in the same way.
> 
> **You work best in a Team.** A good group is better than the sum of it's parts. The only thing better than a genius programmer is a cohesive group of genius programmers.
> 
> **You are a liBeral programmer.** Programming is a complex task and you should use white space and comments as freely as possible to help simplify the task. We're not writing on paper anymore so we can take up as much room as we need.
