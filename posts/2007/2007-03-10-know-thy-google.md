A friend of mine just posted an excellent piece of information entitled "[Search Google like a Pro](http://joefruchey.com/blog/wp-trackback.php?p=536 "Search Google like a Pro by Joe")". He covers a lot of advanced searching syntax that will help anyone who has ever been lost on the internet superhighway. It is a great read for all and those that liked my previous "[Advanced Google Features](http://jeremyknight.wordpress.com/2006/07/20/advanced-google-features/ "Advanced Google Features")" will love this post.
