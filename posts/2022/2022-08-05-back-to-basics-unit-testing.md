I will be presenting "Back to Basics: Unit Testing" at [SQL Saturday Baton Rouge 2022](https://sqlsaturday.com/2022-08-06-sqlsaturday1026/) on Aug 5, 2022. This will be a beginner topic and I'll be assuming no unit testing experience. All code examples will be in C#. Here's the description I sent in:

> In this session, we'll discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and best practices of unit tests. We'll then talk about the different unit testing tools and get into demos.
