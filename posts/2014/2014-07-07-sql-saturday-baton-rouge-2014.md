First, [SQL Saturday Baton Rouge 2014](http://sqlsaturday.com/324/eventhome.aspx "SQL Saturday Baton Rouge 2014") has opened registration and placed the session list online. If you're interested in development at all this is a must attend event. The sessions span all areas of development. The tracks include: .NET, Business Intelligence, Career Development, CIO/IT Manager, DBA, IT Pro, PowerShell, SharePoint, SQL Dev, and Web/Mobile dev. Please visit the website and sign up if you're interested.

Secondly, I will be presenting "Testable WebForms with MVP". This will be an intermediate topic and I'll be assuming experience using ASP.NET WebForms and a basic understanding of unit testing. All code examples will be in C#. Here's the description I sent in:

*MVC is all the rage but what about all the code you already have written in ASP.NET WebForms? How can you make it maintainable and testable? In this session, I'll show how you can make WebForms applications testable using Model-View-Presenter.*
