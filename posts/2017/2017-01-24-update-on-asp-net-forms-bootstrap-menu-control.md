I finally took the time to move my ASP.NET Forms Bootstrap Menu Control code over to a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/knight0323/aspnet-forms-bootstrap-menu). Because of the move, I've closed the comments on the [original post](../../2014/2014-02-25-asp-net-forms-bootstrap-menu-control/) in hopes of moving all discussion regarding the control to its repository.

I've also built out 2 separate example projects. The first shows how to use the control with just the class file. The second shows how to use the control by referencing the project from a separate class library.
