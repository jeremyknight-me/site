I presented "Testing In-Depth" at [SQL Saturday Baton Rouge 2024](https://sqlsaturday.com/2024-07-27-sqlsaturday1076/ "SQL Saturday Baton Rouge 2024") on July 27, 2024. Below is the topic information.

<h3>Testing In-Depth</h3>

This will be an intermediate topic and I'll be assuming developers already understand the basics of unit testing. All code examples will be in C#. Here's the session's description:
 
> Software testing is a vital skill for any developer who wants to deliver high-quality, reliable software. This session will explore unit testing and more advanced topics, such as mocking, integration tests, and mutation testing. It will also show tools and packages that can help you automate your testing process and make it more productive.
